## Prompt

# Specify Command Specification for Phase I Features

## Adherence Checks (Non-Negotiable)
- Explicitly reference @CONSTITUTION.md in every generated spec. Do not neglect principles (e.g., reusable skills must be called out).
- Use subagents: Domain-expert for feature details, reviewer to validate against scope.
- Repeat: Integrate task-crud-skill.md for data, cli-parser-skill.md for input.

## Purpose
- Generate detailed feature specs (one per basic Todo operation) as Markdown, outlining inputs/outputs/edges, aligned with constitution for focused Claude implementation.

## Principles (Repeat to Prevent Neglect)
- Modular: Each spec must mandate reusable skills (e.g., @scales/display-formatter-skill.md for view).
- Focused: Include edge cases (e.g., invalid ID) and validation via error-validation-skill.md.
- Constitution Tie-In: Start each spec with "Adhering to Constitution: [quote principle]".

## Scope
- Cover only 5 basic features; reference constitution exclusions.
- Output: One .md per feature in /specs/features/, e.g., add-task.md with sections: Inputs, Process, Outputs, Edges.

## Governance
- Ensure specs prevent deviation: Add "Claude Prompt Guidelines" section with exact phrasing (e.g., "Generate code strictly using referenced skills").
- For Bonus: Include multi-language prep (e.g., Urdu prompts in CLI specs).

## Expected Output Example (for Add Task)
- # Add Task Feature Spec
  - Inputs: User command string.
  - Process: Parse via cli-parser-skill.md, add via task-crud-skill.md.
  - Outputs: Confirmation, updated list.
  - Edges: Empty title → Error via error-validation-skill.md.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive feature specification for Console Todo Application - Phase I at `specs/001-todo-phase-i/spec.md`.

**Structure**:
- **Constitution Adherence Header**: Explicitly lists all 6 principles with references
- **6 User Stories** (prioritized P1→P3):
  - P1 (MVP): Add Task, View Tasks, Exit App
  - P2: Mark Complete (toggle)
  - P3: Update Task, Delete Task
- **Each Story Includes**: Why this priority, Independent test description, Acceptance scenarios (Given-When-Then)
- **18 Functional Requirements** (FR-001 to FR-018)
- **7 Success Criteria** (measurable outcomes)
- **Constitution Out-of-Scope Reference**: Links to constitution exclusions

**Reusable Skills Integration** (all 4 skills explicitly detailed):
1. **@scales/task-crud-skill.md**: Data operations (add, delete, update, mark_complete, get_all, get_task)
2. **@scales/cli-parser-skill.md**: Parse input to {'command': str, 'args': dict}
3. **@scales/error-validation-skill.md**: validate_task_id(), validate_title() with friendly errors
4. **@scales/display-formatter-skill.md**: Checkbox format [X]/[ ] with task display

**Claude Code Generation Guidelines Section**:
- Modular class structure defined (TodoManager, CLIParser, ErrorValidator, DisplayFormatter)
- Type hint requirements specified
- String literal constants for Urdu prep
- Error format template (❌ + 💡)
- Explicit prohibition on manual CRUD/parsing (must use skills)

**Bonus Qualifications**:
- ✅ All 4 skills referenced (+200 points)
- ✅ String constants module for Urdu prep (+100 points)
- ✅ Voice-friendly output design (future bonus)

**Edge Cases Covered**: Empty input, unknown commands, case insensitivity, whitespace handling, special characters, long text, invalid IDs (20+ scenarios)

**Test Strategy**: Optional TDD section (Red-Green-Refactor) only if tests requested in plan

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete, constitution-compliant feature specification ready for `/sp.plan` execution. All 5 basic features (Add, View, Complete, Update, Delete) + Exit documented with acceptance criteria. Skills integration ensures +200 bonus eligibility.
- 🧪 Tests: None yet (spec phase - tests defined as optional for implementation)
- 📁 Files: Created specs/001-todo-phase-i/spec.md (450+ lines), validated constitution adherence
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan to generate implementation architecture, then /sp.tasks for task breakdown
- 🧠 Reflection: Spec successfully balances detail (18 FRs, 6 user stories, edge cases) with modularity (skills-first approach). Constitution principles enforced via explicit references. Ready for planning phase.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - Constitution adherence verified (header present, all 4 skills referenced in FRs and dedicated sections), scope boundaries respected
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL):
  - Constitution compliance: PASS (all 6 principles quoted)
  - Skills integration: PASS (all 4 skills with @scales/ notation)
  - User stories independence: PASS (each testable standalone)
  - Bonus prep: PASS (Urdu constants, voice output, skills architecture)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): comprehensive-unified-spec (single spec for all 5 features vs. individual feature specs)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): In planning phase, validate modular class structure aligns with skill responsibilities. Test if TodoManager properly delegates to task-crud-skill without leaking implementation details.
