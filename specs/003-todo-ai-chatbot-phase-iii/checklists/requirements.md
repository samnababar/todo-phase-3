# Specification Quality Checklist: AI-Powered Todo Chatbot (Phase III)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)
**Validation Status**: PASSED

---

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - **Status**: PASS - Specification focuses on WHAT not HOW
  - **Note**: Technology references (Neon, Resend, OpenAI) are in Dependencies section only, not functional requirements

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
  - **Status**: PASS - All user stories focus on user-facing outcomes

- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
  - **Status**: PASS - Language is accessible, technical jargon minimized

- [x] All mandatory sections completed
  - **Status**: PASS - User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Key Entities all present

---

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
  - **Status**: PASS - No clarification markers in specification

- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - **Status**: PASS - Each FR has clear, testable conditions

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
  - **Status**: PASS - All SC items include specific metrics (time, percentage, count)

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
  - **Status**: PASS - SC items describe user outcomes, not system internals

- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - **Status**: PASS - Each user story has Given/When/Then scenarios

- [x] Edge cases are identified
  - **Status**: PASS - 7 edge cases documented covering error scenarios

- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
  - **Status**: PASS - Out of Scope section explicitly lists 15 excluded features

- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - **Status**: PASS - 10 assumptions and 6 dependencies documented

---

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - **Status**: PASS - 62 functional requirements with specific conditions

- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - **Status**: PASS - 7 user stories covering all major functionality

- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - **Status**: PASS - 15 success criteria with quantifiable metrics

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - **Status**: PASS - Implementation choices deferred to planning phase
