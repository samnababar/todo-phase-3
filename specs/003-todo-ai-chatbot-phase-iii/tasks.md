# Tasks: AI-Powered Todo Chatbot (Phase III)

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/1-ai-todo-chatbot/`
**Prerequisites**: spec.md (user stories), user-provided task breakdown
**Tests**: Not explicitly requested - implementation tasks only

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Frontend**: `frontend/` (Next.js App Router)
- **Backend**: `backend/` (Python FastAPI)
- **Specs**: `specs/` (Spec-Kit Plus)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: No dependencies - start immediately
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Depends on Phase 1 - **BLOCKS all user stories**
- **Phase 3 (US1 - Auth)**: Depends on Phase 2 - MVP foundation
- **Phase 4 (US2 - Chat)**: Depends on Phase 3 (needs auth)
- **Phase 5 (US3 - History)**: Depends on Phase 4 (needs chat backend)
- **Phase 6 (US4 - Reminders)**: Depends on Phase 4 (needs MCP tools)
- **Phase 7 (US5 - Landing)**: Depends on Phase 2 only - can run parallel with US1+
- **Phase 8 (US6 - Dashboard)**: Depends on Phase 3 (needs auth) - can run parallel with US2+
- **Phase 9 (US7 - Security)**: Depends on all backend phases
- **Phase 10 (Chat Polish)**: Depends on Phases 4 and 5

**Days 9-10**: Phase 10 + Phase 11 (Polish + Deploy + Submit)

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies - run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Test all user flows before moving to next phase
