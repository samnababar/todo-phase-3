## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - User Registration and Login (Priority: P1)

A new user visits the application and creates an account using their email, name, and a secure password. After registration, they are automatically logged in and redirected to their dashboard. Returning users can log in with their credentials.

**Why this priority**: Authentication is foundational - no other features can function without users being able to securely access the system. This is the critical path for all subsequent functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing the signup flow with valid credentials and verifying the user lands on the dashboard with a valid session. Delivers immediate value as the entry point to the application.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor on the signup page, **When** they enter a valid name (2-100 chars), valid email, and valid password (8+ chars, 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 number), **Then** their account is created and they are redirected to /dashboard with an active session
2. **Given** a visitor with an existing email, **When** they attempt to signup, **Then** they see an error message indicating the email is already registered
3. **Given** a registered user on the login page, **When** they enter correct credentials, **Then** they are redirected to /dashboard with an active session
4. **Given** a user who failed login 5 times, **When** they attempt a 6th login within 15 minutes, **Then** they see a rate-limiting message and must wait
5. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they close their browser and return within 7 days, **Then** they remain logged in (session persisted)

---

### User Story 2 - AI-Assisted Task Management via Chat (Priority: P1)

A logged-in user navigates to the AI Assistant page and has a natural conversation to manage their tasks. They can create, view, update, complete, and delete tasks using plain language. The AI understands context like "tomorrow at 3pm" and confirms actions before executing them.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of the product - an AI-powered task management experience. Without this, the application is just another todo list.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by sending a message like "Add a task to buy groceries tomorrow at 3pm" and verifying the task appears in the task list with the correct reminder set.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a logged-in user on the AI Assistant page, **When** they type "Add a task to call mom tomorrow at 2pm", **Then** the AI creates the task and responds with confirmation including the parsed date/time
2. **Given** a user with existing tasks, **When** they ask "Show me my pending tasks", **Then** the AI displays a list of their incomplete tasks
3. **Given** a user with a task, **When** they say "Mark task 1 as done", **Then** the task is marked complete and any pending reminder is cancelled
4. **Given** a user in a conversation, **When** they send multiple messages, **Then** the AI maintains context from the conversation history
5. **Given** a new conversation, **When** the first message is processed, **Then** a conversation title is auto-generated from the message content

---

### User Story 3 - Persistent Chat History (Priority: P2)

A user who has had previous conversations with the AI can access their chat history. They can start new conversations, switch between existing ones, and see message timestamps. Conversations are organized newest-first.

**Why this priority**: Enhances the AI chat experience by providing continuity across sessions. Important but not blocking for core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by having a conversation, refreshing the page, and verifying the conversation appears in the history sidebar and can be resumed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user with past conversations, **When** they visit the AI Assistant page, **Then** they see a list of conversations sorted by most recent
2. **Given** a conversation list, **When** the user clicks on a past conversation, **Then** the full message history loads in the chat area
3. **Given** a user in an active chat, **When** they click "New Chat", **Then** a new empty conversation is started and added to the history
4. **Given** a conversation, **When** viewing messages, **Then** each message displays a timestamp in relative format (e.g., "2 hours ago")

---

### User Story 4 - Task Reminders via Email (Priority: P2)

A user can set reminders when creating or updating tasks. When the reminder time arrives, they receive an email notification. Reminders show on task cards with their scheduled time.

**Why this priority**: Adds significant value by helping users not forget important tasks. Builds on top of the task management foundation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a task with a reminder set for 5 minutes in the future and verifying an email is received within the reminder window.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user creating a task, **When** they enable the reminder toggle and set a date/time, **Then** the task is created with an associated reminder
2. **Given** a task with a pending reminder, **When** the reminder time arrives (within 5-minute check window), **Then** an email is sent to the user's registered email
3. **Given** a task with a reminder, **When** the task is marked complete, **Then** the reminder is cancelled and no email is sent
4. **Given** a task card, **When** it has a reminder set, **Then** the reminder date/time is displayed with a bell icon
5. **Given** a reminder email, **When** the user reads it, **Then** it contains the task title, description, and a link to the dashboard

---

### User Story 5 - Landing Page Experience (Priority: P2)

A visitor arrives at the landing page and sees an impressive, animated introduction to the product. The page has a dark theme with purple accents, showcasing the AI chat, reminder, and organization features. Clear call-to-action buttons guide them to sign up.

**Why this priority**: First impression for new users. Important for conversion but doesn't affect core functionality for existing users.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by visiting the landing page and verifying all animations play smoothly, images load, and CTA buttons navigate correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor on the landing page, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see an animated hero section with headline sliding in and image fading in
2. **Given** a visitor scrolling down, **When** feature cards come into view, **Then** they animate in with a fade-up effect
3. **Given** a visitor on mobile, **When** viewing the page, **Then** the layout stacks vertically and remains fully functional
4. **Given** a visitor, **When** they click "Get Started", **Then** they are navigated to the signup page

---

### User Story 6 - Dashboard Task Management (Priority: P2)

A logged-in user can view and manage their tasks from the dashboard. They see task statistics, can filter tasks, and access navigation to other sections. The dashboard provides a traditional UI alternative to the AI chat.

**Why this priority**: Provides a familiar interface for users who prefer traditional task management. Complements the AI chat interface.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by logging in, viewing task stats, and verifying tasks can be filtered and completed from the dashboard.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a logged-in user on the dashboard, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see task statistics (total, completed, pending)
2. **Given** a user with tasks, **When** they view the task list, **Then** tasks are displayed as cards with title, description, and reminder info
3. **Given** a user hovering over a task card, **When** they interact, **Then** the card elevates with a purple glow effect
4. **Given** a user on mobile, **When** they view the dashboard, **Then** the sidebar collapses and navigation is accessible via menu

---

### User Story 7 - Secure Session Management (Priority: P3)

A user's session is secured with industry-standard practices. Tokens expire after 7 days, all API routes require authentication, and user ownership is verified for all operations.

**Why this priority**: Security is critical but operates invisibly when functioning correctly. The security measures are baked into all other stories.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by attempting to access protected routes without authentication and verifying 401 responses.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an unauthenticated request, **When** accessing /api/* routes, **Then** a 401 Unauthorized response is returned
2. **Given** a user's token, **When** it's older than 7 days, **Then** it is rejected and the user must re-authenticate
3. **Given** a user attempting to access another user's tasks, **When** the request is processed, **Then** a 403 Forbidden response is returned

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user loses internet connection mid-chat? (Show offline indicator, queue messages for retry)
- How does the system handle reminder times in the past? (Reject with validation error)
- What if the email service is temporarily unavailable? (Retry up to 3 times, log failure)
- What happens when a user types a message while AI is still responding? (Queue the message, send after response)
- How does the system handle very long task titles? (Truncate at 200 characters with validation message)
- What if a conversation has no messages? (Show empty state with prompt to start chatting)
- What happens when the MCP server is unreachable? (Return user-friendly error, log for monitoring)
